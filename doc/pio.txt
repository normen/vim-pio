INTRODUCTION                                    *pio*

This is a collection of helper commands for VIM to ease the use of
PlatformIO with VIM.

COMMANDS                                        *pio-commands*

The commands are the core of the plugin, allowing for basic control
of PlatformIO projects.

                                                *:PIO*
:PIO {args}               Works like the platformio shell command, uses a
                          single `:term` window. E.g. use `:PIO` `settings get`
                          to show the global platformio settings.

                                                *:PIOMonitor*
:PIOMonitor               Starts a `:term` window with a `:PIO` `device monitor`
                          command running. Can be opened separately from the
                          main `:PIO` term window.

                                                *:PIONewProject*
:PIONewProject [args]     Shows a list of boards to select from. You can
                          supply search terms to limit the board list, e.g.
                          'esp32'.

                          Pressing <CR> on a board name will create a new
                          PlatformIO Project in the current folder or add
                          the board to an existing project.

                          It is effectively the same as running the command
                          `:PIO` `project init --ide vim --board {boardname}`

                          However `:PIONewProject` will also create a
                          |Makefile| in the root folder and a "main.cpp" file
                          in the "src" folder if they don't exist.

                          Running the command `:PIO` `boards` will display the
                          same list with the same functions.

                                                *:PIOAddLibrary*
:PIOAddLibrary {search}   Shows a list of available libraries based on the
                          supplied search terms. Press <CR> on a name or ID
                          in the list to install that library.

                          You can use the following syntax to search for
                          specifics like keywords, headers etc.

                          - id:123
                          - keyword:mqtt
                          - header:RH_ASK.h
                          - framework:Arduino
                          - platform:espressif8266
                          - author:Adafruit

                          The platforms and frameworks of your project are
                          always added to this search, use the command
                          `:PIO` `lib search` directly to avoid this.

                                                *:PIORemoveLibrary*
:PIORemoveLibrary         Shows a list of installed libraries, press <CR> on
                          a name to uninstall that library.

                                                *:PIOInit*
:PIOInit {args}           Creates a new project with the selected board name,
                          supports auto-completion of the name. No list is
                          displayed. Can also be used without an argument to
                          refresh the project files.

                          This yields the same result as running the command
                          `:PIO` `project init --ide vim --board {args}`
                          or
                          `:PIO` `project init --ide vim`

                          However this will also create a |Makefile| in the root 
                          folder and a "main.cpp" file in the "src" folder if
                          they don't exist.

                                                *:PIOInstall*
:PIOInstall {args}        Installs a library by name or id, supports auto-
                          completion of the name. No list is displayed.

                          This yields the same result as running the command
                          `:PIO` `lib install {args}`

                                                *:PIOUninstall*
:PIOUninstall {args}      Removes a library from the project, supports auto-
                          completion of the name. No list is displayed.

                          This yields the same result as running the command
                          `:PIO` `lib uninstall {args}`

MAKEFILE                                        *pio-Makefile*
 
The plugin creates a |Makefile| for the project with the following targets:
- all (default)
- upload
- clean
- program
- uploadfs

This way you can use a simple `:make` `upload` to compile and upload your code
to your microcontroller.

OTHER                                           *pio-other*

Code completion~
To get code completion please install |ccls| and a vim plugin to handle
language servers (e.g. |vim-lsp| or |coc-nvim|).
